.. warning::
  This release introduces breaking changes.
  Models trained using older versions of tomoDRGN are not compatible with this release; new models should be trained instead.
  Models trained using this release of tomoDRGN are not compatible with the older versions of tomoDRGN; the latest tomoDRGN version should be used instead.

Major release! Expanded upstream software compatibility, added documentation and tutorials, new analyses and plots, improved performance, reduced bugs, and more.

- New features

  * Added compatibility with upstream STA software: NextPYP and WarpTools (including metadata formats and float16 images)
  * Added documentation, including software overview, installation guide, function API, script usage and common next steps / pitfalls, and tutorials
  * Added end-to-end test suites for toy datasets from different upstream STA software (``tomodrgn/testing/commandtest*.py``)
  * Added a new ``tomodrgn analyze_volumes`` command to perform analysis of a volume ensemble in real space (complementary to latent space analysis with ``tomodrgn analyze``)
  * Added a new jupyter notebook template that is streamlined to interactive analysis of (1) dataset-wide property correlations via 2-D scatter plot, and (2) per-tomogram spatially contextualized properties via 3-D scatter plot and optional tomogram overlay

- Changes

  * Simplified installation process, and removed some dependencies
  * Faster and more flexible star file parsing and dataset loading
  * Faster and lower memory dataset processing and model training / inference
  * Standardized and expanded set of static plots generated by ``tomodrgn analyze`` and ``tomodrgn analyze_volumes``
  * ``tomodrgn filter_star`` now supports directly passing a list of selected classes and the per-particle class labels
  * ``tomodrgn subtomo2chimerax`` now automatically evaluates the trained tomoDRGN model to produce required volumes for the specified tomogram(s)
  * Refactored the full analysis jupyter notebook template to and renamed to _legacy
  * Volume generation via model decoding now uses a ``models.VolumeGenerator`` instance instead of subprocess calls to ``tomodrgn eval_vol`` for faster and more robust execution
  * Updated dependency compatibility (python >= 3.10, pytorch >= 2.3, numpy < 2.0)
  * Uniform command options and reasonable defaults across different scripts
  * Consolidated redundant code and removed unused code

- Bugfixes

  * Many! And probably also introduced many bugs at the same time. Please let us know if you come across a potential bug by filing an issue on Github


v0.2.1
-------

- New features

  * Added ``--dose-override`` option when loading images to manually specify dose in e-/A2/image
  * Added ``--starfile-source`` option to ``filter_star.py`` to allow filtering RELION3.1-format star files from RELION
  * Added ``--write-tiltseries-starfile`` option to ``downsample.py`` to write RELION3.0-format star file to downsampled images
  * Added multiple options for pooling tilt images between ``train_vae.py`` encoder A and encoder B per particle
  * Exposed pytorch dataloader options to user in ``train_vae.py``, ``train_nn.py``, ``eval_images.py``
  * ``convergence_nn.py`` saves FSCs calculated per epoch to pkl file
  * Added ``--batch-size`` to ``eval_vol.py`` calling parallelized ``models.FTPositionalDecoder.gen_volume_batch`` for accelerated volume generation
  * Added ``--vol-path`` to ``subtomo2chimerax.py`` allowing use of consensus reconstruction instead of unique tomodrgn volumes
  * Added new ``quicktest.py`` and ``unittest.py`` interface
  * Added ``load`` method using ``config.pkl`` file to easily create ``dataset.TiltSeriesMRCData`` object

- Changes

  * Faster dataset loading with improved file I/O
  * Dataset preprocessing refactored to numpy arrays
  * Decreased memory utilization in ``dataset.TiltSeriesMRCData`` preprocessing
  * Decreased memory utilization in ``starfile.TiltSeriesStarfile`` initialization
  * Decreased memory utilization by gaussian positional encoding
  * Changed default positional encoding to ``gaussian``
  * Changed default latent dimensionality to ``--zdim 128``
  * ``train_vae.py`` checks for NaN/inf during checkpoint evaluation
  * ``utils.calc_fsc`` allows input volumes to be either paths to .mrc files or direct numpy arrays
  * New plots in ``convergence_vae.py`` including all loss types, all-to-all volumetric correlation coefficients among tomodrgn (and optionally ground truth) volumes
  * Changed default ``subtomo2chimerax.py`` color map to ChimeraX color scheme
  * Added requirement for pytorch>=1.11

- Bugfixes

  * Fixed syntax of internal calls to ``eval_vol.py``
  * Fixed dataset index filtering of pre-filtered datasets
  * Added assert for convergence scripts that requisite input files exist
  * Fixed bug where ``config.pkl`` containing CUDA tensors could not be loaded on cpu
  * Fixed bug where precalculated ``norm`` would be ignored when loading dataset from ``config.pkl`` with ``--lazy``

v0.2.0
--------

- Features

  * added support for datasets with variable tilts per tomogram (tilt counts/schemes/etc)
  * new scripts ``subtomo2chimerax`` and ``filter_star``
  * additional features and checks in ``tomoDRGN_viz+filt.ipynb``
  * ``eval_images`` supports ``z.pkl`` output; ``eval_vol`` supports ``z.pkl`` input
  * new tests ``unittest.sh`` and ``quicktest.sh``
  * validated compatibility with python 3.7 - 3.10 and pytorch 1.8 - 1.12

- Changes

  * refactored the majority of codebase for explicit internal tomoDRGN compatibility and some performance improvements
  * updated tomoDRGN install requirements and changed to ``pip``-based installation
  * ``--amp`` is now enabled by default and can be disabled with ``--no-amp``
  * ``--do-dose-weighting``, ``--do-tilt-weighting``, ``--dose-mask`` have been renamed to ``--recon-dose-weight``, ``--recon-tilt-weight``, ``--l-dose-mask``, respectively
  * ``tomodrgn downsample`` now benefits from pytorch-based GPU acceleration
  * updated training hyperparameter defaults
  * (many) various bugfixes
