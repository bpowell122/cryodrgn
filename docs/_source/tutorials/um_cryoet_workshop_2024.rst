Tutorial: U-M cryoET workshop 2024
====================================

This is a tutorial document prepared for the University of Michigan cryo-ET workshop in June of 2024.
The goal of the tutorial is to reproduce heterogeneous ribosome data from cryo-ET benchmark dataset EMPIAR-10499, as described in our tomoDRGN manuscript.
The tutorial uses many precomputed results available on EMPIAR and Zenodo.

.. caution::

    The precomputed results are only compatible with the version of tomoDRGN released at publication (v0.2.2).
    This tutorial is not compatible with more updated versions of tomoDRGN.
    However, it may still be useful as a conceptual guide / workflow reference.
