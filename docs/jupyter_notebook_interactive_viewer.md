Example usage of the Jupyter notebook 3-D interactive tomogram and particle viewer in generating Figure 5D from the tomoDRGN bioRxiv paper. This video highlights:
1. rendering of tomograms in slice view along selectable axes,
2. rendering of particles as oriented cones, 
3. colormapping particles by a selectable numerical attribute, 
4. annotating particle subsets by some numerical attribute range, 
5. hovering over a given particle to obtain its global index and value of the selected numerical attribute.
